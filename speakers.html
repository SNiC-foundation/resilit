His second mission is the longest spaceflight in European history. In total the ESA astronaut spent 204 days in space: 11 days during mission DELTA in 2004 and 193 days during mission PromISSe.</p><p class="speaker-page-p">After years of training in Houston, Moscow, Cologne, Montreal and Tokyo, a Russian Soyuz spaceship launched André and his two crew members from Russia and America on the 21st of December 2011 from Kazakhstan. Two days later he arrived at the International Space Station to live and work for six months. On board he was not only a medical doctor, scientist and flight engineer, but also handyman and ambassador for several charities. On the 1st of July 2012, André returned to Earth and landed in his space capsule in the Kazakh steppe. </p><p class="speaker-page-p">Astronaut André Kuipers offers a unique look behind the scenes of international human spaceflight. He shares his story about the training, the mission and his exceptional view of our planet. </p></div></div><hr/><span class="speaker-anchor" id="haupt"></span><div class="session"><h3>Michael Haupt</h3><p class="haupt"></p><div class="speaker-image-container"><img class="speaker-image" src="images/speakers/Haupt.jpeg"/></div><h5>Biography</h5><div class="shorten"><p class="speaker-page-p">Michael Haupt is a certified Strategic Foresight Practitioner, General Systems Theorist and Executive Director, Project 2030, EARTHwise Centre.

His work has been combining the two domains for more than 20 years, including his PhD research in volcano remote sensing (2002) at the University of Cambridge (UK). His main research interest centers on post-disaster response and damage assessment with geodata, where the deployment of many novel satellite systems over the last 2 decades has led to highly diverse methodologies to assess the consequences of disasters. The proliferation of both experimental and commercial drones/UAV over the last 10 years has been even more remarkable, and has allowed damage assessment at a far more sophisticated level. Recent methodological advances very well illustrate a shift from more traditional image processing and photogrammetry approaches towards state-of-the-art computer vision and computer science methods. In recent years the damage assessment work has been extended to include also post-disaster recovery assessment, coupled with macro-economic modelling, both linked to resilience, and includes the use of crowdsourced information/VGI.</p></div></div><hr/><span class="speaker-anchor" id="wall"></span><div class="session"><h3>Dr. PJ Wall</h3><p class="wall"></p><div class="speaker-image-container"><img class="speaker-image" src="images/speakers/PJ.jpeg"/></div><h5>Biography</h5><div class="shorten"><p class="speaker-page-p">Dr P.J. Wall is a researcher and lecturer with the ADAPT Centre (www.adaptcentre.ie) in the School of Computer Science, Trinity College Dublin.  His research examines technological innovation in the Global South (ICT4D) with particular focus on the use of mobile devices/apps and artificial intelligence, and the ethical implications associated with using such technology in this context.  His main interest concerns the social, cultural, and political aspects of the implementation and use of these technologies.  His current research is based in Sierra Leone and examines the role of mobile phones in reconfiguring public health systems and practices (mHealth), as well as an exploration of how such mobile devices are implemented, adopted, scaled, and sustained.</p></div></div><hr/><span class="speaker-anchor" id="aalmoes"></span><div class="session"><h3>Roalt Aalmoes</h3><h4 class="aalmoes">NLR</h4><div class="speaker-image-container"><img class="speaker-image" src="images/speakers/Aalmoes.jpg"/></div><h5>Biography</h5><div class="shorten"><p class="speaker-page-p">Roalt Aalmoes received his Master's Degree in Computer Science at the Twente University in Enschede, The Netherlands.
