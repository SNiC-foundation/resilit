Borders dividing countries are not visible from space. What is visible from space are the global challenges humankind faces: climate change, deforestation, erosion, the consequences of urbanisation. When looking at Earth from space it becomes clear that we live on a small planet in a big and dark universe; Earth is in fact itself a ‘spaceship’ with limited supplies. New technologies – from recycling to satellite Earth observation – are needed to ensure a good future for all of us.&quot;],&quot;speakerId&quot;:&quot;kuipers&quot;,&quot;startTimeDisplay&quot;:&quot;10:15&quot;,&quot;endTimeDisplay&quot;:&quot;11:00&quot;,&quot;length&quot;:9,&quot;speaker&quot;:{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Dr. André Kuipers&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;kuipers&quot;,&quot;image&quot;:&quot;/images/speakers/Kuipers.jpg&quot;,&quot;company&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;bio&quot;:[&quot;&lt;i&gt;Astronaut &amp; Ambassador of Earth.&lt;/i&gt;&quot;,&quot;André Kuipers is the first Dutchman with two space missions to his name.

These are zones where human-to-human and human-to-nature exchange is non-discriminatory and system-regulated, based on the principles of living systems. The location, size and shape of SEEZs are informed by bioregionalism. Bioregions are defined through physical and environmental features, including watershed boundaries and soil and terrain characteristics, rather than political boundaries. These bioregions form the logical locations for the emergence of Society 4.0.&quot;,&quot;Michael will present his vision for Society 4.0 and explain the vast challenge ahead for computer scientists as we collect the data required to operationalise a transition from stagnant societies to a thrivability civilisation, all based on data and science.&quot;],&quot;speakerId&quot;:&quot;haupt&quot;,&quot;startTimeDisplay&quot;:&quot;11:20&quot;,&quot;endTimeDisplay&quot;:&quot;12:20&quot;,&quot;length&quot;:12,&quot;speaker&quot;:{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Michael Haupt&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;haupt&quot;,&quot;image&quot;:&quot;/images/speakers/Haupt.jpeg&quot;,&quot;company&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;bio&quot;:[&quot;Michael Haupt is a certified Strategic Foresight Practitioner, General Systems Theorist and Executive Director, Project 2030, EARTHwise Centre.

Past decades were largely characterized by a focus on disaster response, which has given way to disaster risk reduction and mitigation measures. Given that natural events causing harm and damage are not entirely preventable, in recent years there has also been an increased focus on resilience, the ability to absorb a shock and rebound. &quot;,&quot;Given the need for rapid information on the consequences of a disaster event, remote sensing plays an important role, and virtually all types of sensors mounted on a range of air- and spaceborne platforms have been used during the response phase. Nevertheless, automated, accurate and comprehensive damage mapping techniques continue to lack, for a variety of reasons. Damage types are highly variable as a function of geographic location, cultural conditions, building materials used, and the hazard type(s) that caused the devastation. In particular satellites, despite their vast reach and ability to provide image data quickly, have limited utility given that they reduce what is often a complex 3-dimensional damage situation to an image that shows hardly more than the roof. In addition, remote sensing data have distinct limitations when it comes to assessing functional damage that may be more critical than actual physical consequences. &quot;,&quot;Recent years have seen a surge in the use of UAV/drones for damage mapping, and our research focuses on those platforms. This talk will provide an overview of how the largely texture-based classification of satellite images has given way to sophisticated 3D scene reconstruction with advanced photogrammetry and computer vision tools. In the last few years there has been a further shift, with methods coming from computer science gaining prominence. In particular deep learning with convolutional networks had opened new doors in damage detection.&quot;,&quot;We have also been extending our damage work into the recovery phase, given that recovery performance is a very good cue of actual resilience, and here we combine both remote sensing image analysis and macro-economic modelling. The ultimate aim is to perform both automated damage detection and to provide timely and actionable information for decision makers as to how best to increase resilience after a disaster event.&quot;],&quot;startTimeDisplay&quot;:&quot;14:15&quot;,&quot;endTimeDisplay&quot;:&quot;15:00&quot;,&quot;length&quot;:9,&quot;speaker&quot;:{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Prof. Dr. Norman Kerle&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;kerle&quot;,&quot;image&quot;:&quot;/images/speakers/Norman.jpg&quot;,&quot;company&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;bio&quot;:[&quot;Prof. Dr. Norman Kerle holds a chair for remote sensing and disaster risk management at the faculty Geoinformation Science and Earth Observation (ITC) at the University of Twente in Enschede. His work has been combining the two domains for more than 20 years, including his PhD research in volcano remote sensing (2002) at the University of Cambridge (UK). His main research interest centers on post-disaster response and damage assessment with geodata, where the deployment of many novel satellite systems over the last 2 decades has led to highly diverse methodologies to assess the consequences of disasters. The proliferation of both experimental and commercial drones/UAV over the last 10 years has been even more remarkable, and has allowed damage assessment at a far more sophisticated level. Recent methodological advances very well illustrate a shift from more traditional image processing and photogrammetry approaches towards state-of-the-art computer vision and computer science methods. In recent years the damage assessment work has been extended to include also post-disaster recovery assessment, coupled with macro-economic modelling, both linked to resilience, and includes the use of crowdsourced information/VGI.&quot;],&quot;limit&quot;:null,&quot;hidden&quot;:false},&quot;simultaneous&quot;:[7,3,10,12]})"><h4>Better resilience through remote sensing-based damage and recovery assessment</h4><h6>AFASZaal</h6><small>14:15 - 15:00</small><p></p></td><td class="talk-column" id="program-table" rowspan="9" data-id="12" onclick="talkColumnClick({&quot;id&quot;:12,&quot;startTime&quot;:&quot;2019-11-26T14:15:00.000Z&quot;,&quot;endTime&quot;:&quot;2019-11-26T15:00:00.000Z&quot;,&quot;capacity&quot;:12,&quot;enabled&quot;:true,&quot;location&quot;:&quot;Panoramalounge&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Speeddates&quot;,&quot;subTitle&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:[&quot;At the speeddates you get the chance to have a one-on-one conversation with five of our partners.

Technological breakthroughs from the fourth industrial revolution are affecting our daily lives, meanwhile Western society is being rivalled by strong competitor Asia, and especially China. How do we plan for security and freedom in such disruptive times? How does Europe avoid being squashed between America First and the Chinese Dream?&quot;,&quot; How do we leverage the innovations from Artificial Intelligence and the Internet of Things without getting bogged down in geopolitics around 5G?&quot;,&quot;This talk discusses the new nexus of security, geopolitics and digitalization. As we will show, these topics are heavily intertwined. China’s ‘New Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan’ offers an outlook for them to become the global leader in Artificial Intelligence (AI) by 2030, and their ‘Made in 2025’-strategy is aimed for China to become the new global manufacturing, cyber, science and technology innovation superpower. History teaches us that those who set the technical standards will dominate the world. &quot;,&quot;Add into the mix China’s ‘Belt and Road Initiative’, which encompasses over 1 trillion USD in investments, establishing China’s influence on the Eurasian content by investing in all kinds of physical trade infrastructure, such as dry-ports, shipping routes and railways. We can conclude that China plans to re-establish both a digital and a physical silk road.&quot;,&quot;Meanwhile, this hegemonic shift from West to East motivates other countries to join the power game. This is especially apparent in the cyber security domain, where countries such as Russia, Iran, Israel, North Korea and of course America and China are increasingly active. Nation state and organized crime driven cyber-attacks are not only aimed at financial gains, but lately more and more on gaining political influence, acquiring intelligence, preparing for hybrid warfare or disrupting enemy infrastructure.&quot;,&quot;The latter is particularly worrying in times where our social dependencies on digital infrastructure is rapidly increasing. Consider examples such as AI managing factories based on sensor-data, autonomous or connected-cars based on 5G and image recognition, algorithmic profiling of civilians, social-credit systems based on face recognition. These examples will today or tomorrow change our lives drastically.&quot;,&quot;How do we manage trust and security in these complicated digital infrastructures that – upon disruption – may lead to social disturbance? New strategic leadership is necessary to effectively deal with this new security nexus. We are now standing at the cross-roads of managing it. How can open society remain strong in the face of foes and its own fragility, without sacrificing – and instead leveraging – its openness? We are convinced that hegemonic and technological changes present us with threats and show us our weaknesses, but we are moreover convinced that these changes offer us opportunities to build on our strengths as a Dutch and European society and benefit from the uncertainty these big changes cause.&quot;,&quot;But to secure this future, we must act now and together to understand and plan for security and freedom.&quot;],&quot;startTimeDisplay&quot;:&quot;15:20&quot;,&quot;endTimeDisplay&quot;:&quot;16:05&quot;,&quot;length&quot;:9,&quot;speaker&quot;:{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Ruud Verbij &amp; Ties Dams&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;ruudties&quot;,&quot;image&quot;:&quot;/images/speakers/RuudTies.png&quot;,&quot;company&quot;:&quot;KPMG &amp; Clingendael&quot;,&quot;bio&quot;:[&quot;&lt;b&gt;Ties Dams&lt;/b&gt; is Research Fellow at the Clingendael Institute, strategist at Aleph and writer.

Mobile technologies in particular can be found in even the remotest corners of the world, with many people in developing countries more likely to have access to mobile phones than to toilets, clean water or electricity.  It has even been claimed that Uganda has more mobile phones than lightbulbs!&quot;,&quot;This high penetration of mobile technology has created a critical mass of infrastructure which presents the possibility of addressing many of the problems existing in the Global South.  Technology can be transformative … it has the power to positively reconfigure practices in a variety of areas including healthcare, education and other government services.  However, the design, implementation and adoption of any type of technology in the Global South is likely to face a variety of challenges and this has resulted in a high failure rate of such projects.  There are many reasons for this high failure rate, one of which is a focus on the technical aspects of the project (a techno-centric approach).  While the technology itself is very important, the social, political, and cultural aspects associated with the technology (the socio-technical) also need to be considered. &quot;,&quot;One example of the adoption of such a socio-technical approach is a project which uses mobile technologies and apps in the public healthcare system in Sierra Leone.  This mHealth project has been operating since 2013 and has managed to sustain and thrive despite a variety of challenges including a severely resource constrained public health system and one of the largest Ebola outbreaks in history. &quot;,&quot;Also worthy of consideration is the increasing importance of ethics and technological innovation in the Global South.  Technology can be transformative in a positive way, but it can also transform in negative ways which have the potential to cause harm.  We need to start asking not only “how do we successfully implement technology in the Global South?” but also “should we implement technology in the Global South at all?”.  This is particularly relevant when technology which has been designed and developed in wealthy European countries and the US is implemented in countries with very different social, cultural, political and ethical norms.  In addition, more advanced technologies, and particularly AI-based technologies, present new opportunities for Governments and other entities to use such technologies against their own citizens. &quot;],&quot;startTimeDisplay&quot;:&quot;15:20&quot;,&quot;endTimeDisplay&quot;:&quot;16:05&quot;,&quot;length&quot;:9,&quot;speaker&quot;:{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Dr. PJ Wall&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;wall&quot;,&quot;image&quot;:&quot;/images/speakers/PJ.jpeg&quot;,&quot;company&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;bio&quot;:[&quot;Dr P.J.

As for the global (M)SME funding level, the lack of financials on a large scale (approximately 40 percent of the total SME population, being 65 million companies) result in this group being underbanked, as they don’t have access to finance. &quot;,&quot;This global challenge is probably better known as a subject within the inclusive finance theme. In our mission to make financing solutions accessible, transparent and efficient we created a new unique initiative called Evidence Based Lending. Together with Dutch-based tech-start ups we have developed a concept that redefines credit risk, collateral and trust in business lending. By applying IoT and Satellite technology, we are able to register real-time events and objective measurements that usually trigger a pay out or collection in a lending application process. &quot;,&quot;In this talk I will take you through the technology we used in the process from idea to the final prototype ‘the micro farm box (MFB)’. I will go into the embedded software, the used sensors, LoRa communication technology and MFB creation and will show what you can achieve with satellite images. &quot;,&quot;By means of a live demo of the MFB I want to take you through all of these technologies and concepts.
